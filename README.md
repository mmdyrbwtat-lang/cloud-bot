# Set the MONGO_URI environment variable first
export MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/your-database

# Run the migration script
python migrate_to_mongodb.py path/to/store_bot_db.json
```

## üìö Usage

After starting the bot with `/start`, you can interact with it using the following commands:

### Available Commands

### Storing Files

1. **Direct Method**:
   - Simply send any file (photo, video, document, audio, voice message, animation) to the bot
   - Choose a category from the list or create a new one
   - The file will be stored in the selected category

2. **From Categories Menu**:
   - Use `/categories` command
   - Select an existing category or create a new one
   - Send files to add them to the category
   - Click "Done" when finished

3. **From Browsing Interface**:
   - While browsing files, use the "Add Files" button
   - Send files to add them to the current category
   - Click "Done" when finished or "Back to Browse" to return to viewing files

### Browsing and Retrieving Files

1. Use the `/files` command or the "Browse Files" button in the main menu
2. Select a category to view its files
3. The bot will display files in pages of 10 items with:
   - File number and name
   - Navigation controls (Previous/Next page)
   - "Add Files" button to add more files to the current category
4. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages if you have more than 10 files

### Important Notes

- Files are securely stored on Telegram servers
- User data and file references are stored in MongoDB for persistence
- The bot uses inline buttons for navigation, making it easy to use
- When deployed on Render's free tier, the bot may experience a slight delay (30-60 seconds) when receiving the first message after a period of inactivity
- Subsequent messages will be processed quickly once the service is running
